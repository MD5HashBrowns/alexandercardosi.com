          <h1>Eastern Dragon</h1>
          <small>Website Redesign</small>
          <p> In the Eastern Dragon Project, my goal was to recreate the Eastern Dragon&rsquo;s website and logo. The Eastern Dragon&rsquo;s original website lacked some design qualities that I was looking for. It was rather plain looking, and clearly hadn&rsquo;t been updated in some time. There was nothing responsive about the site, and it didn&rsquo;t include the menu in the actual site. I wanted to change all of this, to offer the best experience possible to mobile and desktop users. The logo needed to a simple, yet intuitive logo design. I chose a piece of sushi with some chopsticks. This brings the thought of Asian cuisine and sushi into one logo.<br><br>The website has a modern and sophisticated theme to it. I wanted the user to feel invited, but not at home. This should give the viewer the feeling they are about to go out to eat, and want something high class. I put lots of emphasis on food throughout the page, to attempt let the user feel hungry for what this restaurant is offering. The font family I chose (Open Sans) is sharp and professional. The color scheme is mostly black and white, with a few colors mixed in. This puts a strong emphasis on the colorful images. The project uses a transparent overlay on top of the header image, to bring contrast to the white text. This allows for legibility.<br><br>  I created this project using my favorite text editor, Atom, with a few plugins for Sass and FTP abilities. I coded everything to be perfectly responsive. I used to flexbox model to allow for responsive content without the need to add media queries for each element. On the front page, I took one of the images from the original website and used it for my own. I then added an &ldquo;About&rdquo; header with some Lorem Ipsum as filler text. For the menu section, I took the PDFs from the site, and converted them to SVGs. I then converted these SVGs into JPEG thumbnails. When clicking on the thumbnails, you are brought to the raw SVG, where you can easily read everything on the menu. I even took the liberty of editing parts of the menu to represent changes they had made to it.<br><br>  When creating this project, I learned how important colors really are. I wasn&rsquo;t focusing on colors much in the beginning, but throughout the project I realized I should keep the white and black shades as main components, and only use a small amount of color.</p>
