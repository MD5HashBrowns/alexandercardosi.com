          <h1>Accessibility Website</h1>
          <small>Website Creation</small>
          <p>In the Accessibility Website project, the goal was to create website with the appropriate practices in place for accessibility, which follow the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)'s guidelines. I chose this assignment as it relates heavily to my partner and my upcoming SkillsUSA Champions competition. In order to follow the WAI guidelines, I wanted to incorporate something called Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA). Aria allows screen readers to easily tell what elements on a page are. Screen readers utilize visual progression by reading content starting at the top, and move down until they&rsquo;ve reached the end.<br><br>
          I wanted this website to feel bare-bones, and efficient. The purpose and main focus this project was the accessibility aspect, so that screen readers can easily read elements of the page. I was also targeting people with some visual impairment as well, not just complete blindness. To allow these users to have a good experience, I had to make sure everything looked normal and legible when the screen was zoomed in. This worked perfectly, so I knew that fonts would be legible to those with visual impairments. I also made sure all text had great contrast with its background. In order to create this contrast, I made sure that anywhere text was located had a completely opaque background. Semi-transparent backgrounds with overlaying text is less legible than a solid color.<br><br>
          In order to create this website, I made sure to carefully read WAI-ARIA&rsquo;s documentation, and follow everything properly. This was an important resource because if I wasn&rsquo;t clear on something I could look back on the documentation and reduce confusion. I used Atom as a text editor, which is my usual choice for something like this. I used SCSS (Sass CSS) for styling, and made sure to utilize HTML5 semantic elements (e.g. section, form, nav, article, etc) in my HTML code. I didn&rsquo;t utilize any Javascript or PHP for this project as I felt it was unnecessary and would only put a pointless strain on the client or server load.<br><br>
          When it comes to changes I would&rsquo;ve made on the site, there isn&rsquo;t much. I would do some more research on the role attribute and see if it really is necessary to specify role=&rdquo;navigation&rdquo; on a nav element. At the time I had read an article saying I needed to do this, but looking back I believe that article was outdated. I learned a lot from this project. I dissected the WAI documentation and figured out just how to create a legible website for those with visual impairments or complete visual loss. I can now create a clean looking website that follows the WAI guidelines.<br>
