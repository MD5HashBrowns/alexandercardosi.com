          <h1>Belgen Cycles</h1>
          <small>Website Redesign</small>
          <p>The goal of this project was to create a nice looking re-creation of the Belgen Cycles project. I needed to create a new home page, a new logo, new bikes page, and even a new contact page. I met this goal well, I added each page, and even the required Javascript. I made the website symmetrical, with everything aligned in a center column. The entire site came together quite well in my opinion. Everything contained valid HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code. Meaning it met the World Wide Web Consortium&rsquo;s standards. I kept faithful to the color pallete I used, which added a sense of a harmony and unity to the project. My overall goal was to create a nice experience on the website, without distractions, to maximize usability. Of course, this still leaves room for stylistic things like a background image and a top logo.<br>
           <br>
          This project creates a sense of welcomeness to the user. I used a cooler, darker color scheme, to allow the eye to rest. The overall layout of the website, is intended to allow the user to gracefully scroll down without being distracted by any elements. That is one of the key components in web design: less is more. White space (or negative space) really helped to create the simplicity of the overall website. Even the logo design is simplistic, so the user can easily tell it&rsquo;s a bicycle well and very easily read the company name.<br>
           <br>
          To create the project, I used a couple different tools. For the logo, I used Adobe Illustrator. Inside of Illustrator I first made a circle. Then I added some stroke black to that circle, and filled the inside with a light grey. This logo now looked like a bicycle wheel. I then added a few lines for the inside of the wheel and a nice ribbon, carefully layered to intercept with the wheel. Then I used some enveloped text to allow for a nice arc. I coded the actual website in a program called Atom which is made by Github. Atom is a very nice text editor that allows for various plugins and theming. I made a few directories to things like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), Images and JavaScript. For the structure of the page, I coded everything in HTML5, making sure to use correct semantic elements. For the styling, I used SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), which is an extension for CSS. SASS allows for you to manage things like variables, functions, if statements, nested elements and more within your CSS code. This is extremely useful for keeping your document organized and only using Javascript when it&rsquo;s truly necessary (to keep a small workload on the client&rsquo;s computer). Lastly, I used plain javascript to create a slideshow.<br>
           <br>
          If there were some things I&rsquo;d change about this project it would be the spacing between elements. I left some small areas of space that could look much nicer if they were larger. (Like the background on the front page, for example. I&rsquo;d like to change things I like this because I could&rsquo;ve used a media query to have everything look nice on mobile, while still having a large viewport height on desktop. This would allow the user to examine the bike background more closely, while having even more room to read the content. I also would&rsquo;ve made the footer always stick to the bottom, which I didn&rsquo;t know how to do before, I&rsquo;ve learned it recently.<br>
