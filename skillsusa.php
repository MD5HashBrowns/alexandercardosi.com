          <h1>SkillsUSA: Mimmo's</h1>
          <small>Website Redesign</small>
          <p>The goal of this project was to collaboratively design a recreation of the Mimmo&rsquo;s Pizzeria website for the SkillsUSA Vermont Web Design Competition. I worked with my partner, Ryan Witham, to accomplish this. We could optionally follow one of the color schemes provided. We chose a color scheme which resembled a pizza style. Where the dark green represents some of the green-colored toppings on pizza, and the orange colors represent the the cheese and sauce of the pizza. We wanted to follow this color scheme throughout the entire website. We kept the core components of the original website. This included the about section, the menu, and a contact page with a Google Maps image. No original images were kept because they were too low quality, nor available to us for this competition. Using high resolution images helped us emphasize the idea of quality.<br><br>This website shows off an inviting design theme, that may ignite some hunger in oneself. I personally like to think it adds a sense of interest into the product. It&rsquo;s tempting to click one of the four buttons on the main page, as well navigate the site through the top navigation bar. In order to maintain this inviting theme, its readability was very important. To create a nice readable environment, I used a black overlay to a pizza image, with white text. The dark image contrasts well with the white text, which can be easily read. The website is also responsive, meaning it&rsquo;s mobile-friendly. To easily create a flexible layout, I used the flexbox model for certain elements like the about section and navigation bar. This allows content be wrapped around when the screen size is lowered. <br><br>To create this project, we started off with pen and paper. We sketched out the skeleton of the website as well as some concept art for the logo. This helped us see each other&rsquo;s visions, so we could add some input before the actual design was created. My partner used Adobe Illustrator for the logo design, creating everything as a vector then exporting as a Portable Network Graphic (PNG). I used the Atom text editor for coding the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (front-end web languages). The creation of the logo was done by my partner, where I focused more on the actual website. There was good collaboration between the color scheme choice, and the logo fits very well with the website, to create unity.<br><br>Ryan Witham and I won the SkillsUSA gold medal for this project.</p>
